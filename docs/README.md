View the visualization [here](./public/index.html), or to get the node server running, execute the following commands (assuming you have `node` and `npm` installed):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:robisoniv/clipper.git
$ cd clipper/app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

then navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

Do note this was developed in Firefox on a 15-inch Macbook Pro.

You can also see a quick visualization of the race leg in a THREE.js scene [here](./public/three.html).
