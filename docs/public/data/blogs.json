Our\nname for the Code 2 (as bequeathed by Helen the Huntress Lane) is one that I'm\nnot allowed to repeat here. It decided to have a tantrum yesterday and for the\nremainder of the morning the crew struggled to keep it in line. At about\nmidday, just after we had all had lunch (pesto pasta for the crew and a jar of\nhoney for me) the on-watch crew decided to gybe (that means turn the boat\nwhilst sailing downwind). Everything was set up and the boom was brought into\nthe centre of the boat when a huge monster of a wave went crashing into the\nside of the boat. It caused the boat to broach (lean over very, very far in the\nwrong direction) which in turn caused the Code 2 to fill with air from the\nwrong side, only adding to the pressure being put on the boat to keep falling\nover at the wrong angle. ", "Nanito, my Uruguayan pal, was on the helm and was\nfighting it for all it was worth. At some point though, during any major\nbroach, the helm (the giant steering wheel) will eventually turn as far as it\npossibly can and after that it won't go any further. This is called losing\ncontrol or \"Oh my God what do I do.\" \n\nAll you can do from a steering point of view is hold on and wait for the rest\nof your crew to start adjusting the mainsail to ease out a lot of the air\npressure and therefore right the boat. So that's what our good crew, under the\nfantastic leadership of the Skipper, started to do. Right up until major issue number\ntwo happened (if you haven't been following along, major issue number one was\nthe broach - keep up would you).", "One of the chains in the steering quadrant snapped and\nNano lost all steering abilities from the Starboard side helm. When I say he\nlost steering, I mean that all of a sudden the one chain that was keeping the\nwheel locked in position (hidden in the deep dungeons of the lazerette) broke\nand sent the wheel spinning back in the opposite direction which threw Nano\nright over... to the other helm! So convenient we have two of these things.\nWithin a while the boat was brought back under control and we were steering\nusing only one of the two helms. During the process though, our Code 2 (mediumweight\nspinnaker) developed a small hole and so we had to do a bear headed drop (my\nfavourite type of drop - one where there aren't any other sails up to protect\nthe spinnaker) to bring the sail back down to safety below deck. ", "All was good for about an hour until the guys in the Nav\nStation noticed that we were starting to head north. As in very, very north -\nlike they were about to take me home to Liverpool. Big Mountain Man Roy Hubbard\nwas now on the Port helm and with every wave or gust of wind that was pushing\nthe boat upwards, he was struggling to turn the wheel to bring it back down\nagain. Now Roy has been given the nickname of Bear (which I obviously approve\nof) and so for him to not be able to control the wheel meant something was\ndefinitely up. \n\nWith every turn he made, the helm would slip and just spin round without actually\nmoving the rudder (the little flappy bits of metal that steer the boat through\nthe water). This is when the team realised that we had just suffered major issue\nnumber three. \n\nThe boat now only had half a helm left. In sailing terms this is called a\ncomplete steering failure; for normal folk, we call it scary s***! With only\nhalf a helm left Roy unfortunately lost control of the boat and crash gybed.\nThis is where the boat turns around so far the wrong way that you end up doing\na 180 or even 360 degree turn and the boom, along with all the sails, comes\ncrashing across the deck and refills with wind on the wrong side. I won't lie\nto you - crash gybes can be extremely dangerous and are pretty much the one\nthing you're not supposed to do when sailing down wind. Again thankfully no one\nwas hurt and everyone's safety training kicked in to get through major issue number\nfour.", "We discovered that the woodruff key (the bit that\nconnects the wheel to the mechanisms below) had become slightly, shall we say,\nmashed and therefore was slipping and not engaging. This meant we had to very\nquickly do some \"gentle steering\". Gentle steering is not easy when\nyou're sailing in 30 - 40 knot winds though. With the main, as well as our\nYankee 2 head sail (hoisted to replace the morning's Code 2), now backed and\nfull of wind from the wrong direction we broached again. And again. And again.\nThree times in total the boat fell over and then popped back up. Gentle\nsteering folks - I told you it was hard. These were major issues five, six and\nseven.", "Enter our hero - Cap'n Lance. Within a flash he was back\nup on deck and had taken control of the helm. For the rest of the day he stayed\nthere cooing and whispering to the helm coaxing it to do what he wanted. Now\nI'm willing to admit that the Cap'n can do a very good impression of a bear\ngrowl when he is mad at either faulty equipment or worse, faulty crew. But at\nno point yesterday did he lose his cool. The entire time he was completely\ncalm, cool and collected and it seemed like he had reached a new level of\nsailing enlightenment. Honestly, it was thanks to his brilliant attitude and\ngreat directions that we managed to save the day. ", "As I said, at this point we had the Yankee 2 sailing and\na full main. Obviously, the decision was made to reef the mainsail to 3 reefs\n(reduce it to a quarter of its original size) and to drop the Yankee 2. This\nwould in turn de-power the boat and allow us to regain control. Also at the\nsame time, we needed to rig the emergency tiller (a big metal pole that we can\nuse instead of a steering wheel) in the event that our half a helm finally\ncarked it. So once again, the crew got to it and did exactly that. It took\nabout three hours in total and a lot of serious grunting, swearing, growling\n(from the crew not from the chilled out Cap'n) and altogether hard work but it\ngot done. ", "As a bear it can be hard for me to get involved in the\n\"sailing part\" of sailing so in this instance I chose to sit this one\nout. Similarly, not all of the crew could be on deck to help out during this\nprocess - too many hands and all that. Having said that, the entire team both\nabove deck and below really rallied together. The guys on deck obviously put in\nsome very hard yards re-rigging the sails and recovering the steering all\nwhilst getting drenched by wave after wave. But the team down below did the\nequally important stuff of monitoring the Nav Station, passing up the necessary\ntools and equipment needed, towelling down the drowned rats of the deck crew\nand most importantly, cooking dinner! How our temporary mothers of Sophia Mueller\nand Jan the Man Augustsson managed to keep cooking a full meal in these\nconditions I'll never know.", "And finally, a very, very special shout out needs to go\nto the two supermen who delved deep into the lazerette to fix the broken\nsteering chain. Obviously, we couldn't continue to sail with half a helm so we\nneeded to get that chain fixed ASAP. The unlikeliest of heroes, Pretty Ricky\nput his hand up straight away and helped out with his mate Fretts. The double\nact spent the better part of three hours in a tiny cramped boat basement being\nsplashed about by waves overflowing down the hatch whilst avoiding all the\nother steering cables which were still swinging around. Ohh and did I mention\nthat the laz is where we store the diesel? And the rubbish. The smell. It truly\noffends my furry little nostrils and yet Pretty Ricky and Fretts didn't even\nbat an eyelid. ", "So, we spent the night sailing along with our reefed main\nand with our staysail hoisted to keep control of the boat despite going at a\nmuch slower pace. It has ultimately lost us a number of positions but we\nmanaged to keep the boat from literally breaking apart and more importantly\n(and I'll stress this for a 3rd time) everyone was kept safe and out of harm's\nway. So for now we will keep sailing and keep trying to 'chasse au tresor'\nwhich is French for chasing the gold (yes I'm a very Euro-chic bear when I want\nto be).", "And on that note, dear readers, for those of you who have\nmanaged to survive the past 14 paragraphs, this concludes today's edition of\nSAIL CHAT.

They have been spending a lot of alone time together\nup on the bow and have even developed little pet names for each other. They are\nthe Bull (Nano) and the Bear (Roy) or as I prefer, the Gaucho and the Cowboy.\nThe only problem is, I don't know how to break it to Nano's devoted and ever\nfaithful bunk buddy. Poor little Red will be heart broken when he finds out.\nHere's a young man, with a chiselled jawline and just the right amount of\nfacial hair, who remained faithful to his bunk buddy even when he had to take a\nLeg off and now he's come back to find a new bloke has stepped in. Devastating\nI tells ya.\n\nTo make matters even more dramatic, James McRipper MacFee (not a real doctor,\nglorified nurse) appears to be a slight shade of green with envy that Roy is\nnow on board. Not because he fancies Nano or even Red (although I can't confirm)\nbut because all of a sudden there's a new sailing sheriff in town. I've\nappointed Roy as a temporary watch leader to allow Claire Bear Fulton some\nextra navigation experience and well... James and Roy now need to duke it out\nfor my affections - I mean approval.\n\nFinally it's time to introduce our final new legger for the race. Mr Nick\n\"Sherry\" Sheridan. Sherry is a well-to-do gentleman from northern\nLondon. He used to be an estate agent. Folks, I'd love to make jokes about him\nbut you all know that with a profession like that... it'd just be too easy. In\nany case he tells me that he was born in Pakistan to a father who was born in\nShanghai to a Russian mother and an Irishman for a father. Talk about a mixed\npedigree! We're so glad to have Sherry back after he helped out on the delivery\nfrom Gosport to Liverpool and we welcome him (and his confused heritage) with\nopen arms.\n\nThat's it for now.

In fact, it's\nprobably been one of our worst. We were preparing to hoist our Code 3 (heavyweight\nspinnaker) for the start of the Elliot Brown Ocean Sprint and everything was\nrigged good to go. Little Red (Nick Redman - good looking bowman that he is)\nwas up the front with his Watch Leader James McRipper Macfee (not a real\ndoctor, aspiring dentist, surprisingly also good looking despite his bushman's\nbeard) when a freak wave hit the bow and grabbed a hold of the kite. In one\nfell swoop the spinnaker was taken out of its bag and thrown overboard. Now\nI've since spoken to the boys about their actions and their story does check\nout. Apparently, they each threw themselves against the sail and singlehandedly\nmanaged to claw it back up to the edge of the boat, whilst being smashed by\nwave after wave when they realised that it was too little too late and that if\nthey continued to hold on, they might mess up their hair - so understandably,\nthey had to let go.

So, for the majority of the night we have\nhad to sail with head torches trying to light up the compass whilst we\nscrounged around the boat to find a new light bulb.

Dan sought every\nsingle wave he could find and crashed into them ferociously, covering the\nforedeck with salty wash. Our heroines persevered and continued to serve lunch\nand even began to bake some loaves of bread as they knew that being down below\nmeant they were safe from The Dunker's steering. And this is where our tale\ntakes a mysterious turn. Somehow the galley hatch was left open. Who opened it,\nno one knows. Perhaps it was a forgetful crew member, perhaps it was The Dunker\nhimself, but my bet is that it was the boat fairies who like to cause mischief\nwherever possible (including moving my boots and turning off my instruments in\nthe night).

But unlike bleak mountain tops, or\nthe dark black of the films - the sea was the most beautiful mix of colours -\ndark deep blue - white where it had broken - bright turquoise as the surf mixed\nit all up. Just breath-taking. But the best part was definitely the crew. Just\nseeing these guys and gals managing the weather, enjoying it, experiencing it\nwas incredible.

It's the first time for a long while people have time to\nreflect on what they have and what they are achieving and what it means to them\nas a person. Clearly they are all achieving something remarkable.  \n\nThere is a Bank Holiday weekend feel to the boat. It's a bit like being in a very\nmixed music festival, as both watches play music and with the widely differing\nage ranges aboard, it could most definitely be billed as a \u201cGreat Festival \u2013\nwith something for everyone \u2013 music across the decades. Everyone Welcome\u201d.\nThat aside there is still a lot of attention on steering a good course, VMG,\nthe calls for \u201cgrind\u201d to trim the spinnaker, and where we are in relation to the\nrest of the fleet as the reported positions come in every six hours. There is an\nair of positivity and team spirit, even though we are in the last quarter of the\nstandings. Everyone is trying their hand at helming the kites now, all\nworking in an environment, where people are feeling its safe to learn and have\na go. \u201cFeel the fear and do it anyway\u201d is the attitude showing through.\n \n\nWell it was while Jack Watch were on this morning, when the first \u201cmurder\nvictim\u201d was found. It was a pretty awful crime scene. Well from the sound of\nthe screams, that was my initial reaction. I immediately went into Critical\nIncident mode, trying to remember the Golden Hour principles, I grabbed my life\njacket and ran to the companion way steps, to find a very excited Nicola,\npointing out to starboard - \u201cDolphins!\u201d she screamed, smiling, \u201cDolphins!\u201d.\nWell she was right and thankful it was screams of delight, so no incident\nmanagement required. The second was this afternoon, while I was on deck, with\nUnion Watch, exchanging talk of favourite authors with John (Maclennan \u2013 who\nhas a great treat for him when re returns to dry land as he hasn't read any\nSebastian Faluks yet) when Jayne Harding found the second \u201cvictim\u201d. A high\npitched scream made everyone turn towards the foredeck where she was standing, opened\nmouthed and speechless (a very rare state for Miss Harding), she stood\npointing, again to starboard. This time in a scene that would have fitted into a\n\u201cDespicable  Me Film\u201d, Union Watch all sighed in unison and gleefully cried\n\u201cDolphins!\u201d You have to say it dolphins do have decent PR and never fail to\nbring enjoyment. Maybe they were just enjoying the music being played but they\ndid give a good show.\n\nNow talking of Miss Harding, I have learnt a lesson in the last 24 hours, having\nprepared the 0600Z reporting schedule to send to the Race Office, which we are\nrequired to submit our \u201cSkipper Blog\u201d with. Blog completed I left it with the\ntemplate of our position, COG and SOG etc to be filled in and sent at the\nappropriate time. So was somewhat surprised to see my blog had included a shout\nout for Jayne, when all the Skipper Blogs were circulated by media later in\nthe day. But as I would say \u201cself praise is no praise\u201d isn't that right or\nshould it be \u201cwrite\u201d Harding? But praise to Ray for this evening's meal, cheese\nand onion potato pie and bake beans \u2013 awesome. That combined with this\n\u201crecharging\u201d your love for the sea sailing, life doesn't get much better. \n\nGreat stats from today's team meeting; Distance logged since race 10 start 1005nm,\nDistance Run in last 24 hours  - 207 of which 175 nm (85%) was DMG.

To Jayne Harding and Emma Kelly for victualling in\nSanya, and especially for making wraps so last race, although they did have an\nappearance in two lunches. Tessa Hicks for being the \u201call over it\u201d medic. For\nJeremy Hilton, who put his hand up in Fremantle to be the Additionally\nQualified Person onboard our boat and for occasional listening to my\nsuggestions, then raising an eye brow and uttering the phrase \u201cDo you think\nthat's entirely wise Skip?\u201d To all the crew who have shown they can push and give\nthe extra \u201cone percent\u201d, the development has been impressive on all fronts. \n\nI think we have shown we can be competitive; we need to be able to do it all\nthe time until we cross the line and not just when things are going our way. We\nneed to tighten up on some basic skills and attention to detail. Taking our eye\noff the ball has potentially cost us our hard earned \u201cScoring Gate\u201d points as\nboth lightweight spinnaker sheets were allowed to disappear over the side, a\nhard-learnt lesson. \n\nFinally, a big thank you to you, our family, friends and supporters who without\nyour support and understanding we would not be able to take part in this race.\n(Lorraine, my wife, you get a bonus ''House Point' for your understanding and\npatience you have displayed over the last 12 months).

I've woken up for the 15th time in\none period of sleep fully ready for action and any eventuality. Last night was\nprobably the worst night sleep wise yet on this leg. The crew have handled the\nboat perfectly in the heavy weather provided by mother nature. We have a\nconservative sail plan to reduce panic when the wind increases and damage for\nwhen we get into Cape Town so we don't have too many running repairs to do. You\nknow what they say about sailing it's 90% boredom 10% panic; if this is true I\nwould rather it be 100% boredom.", "For those sat at home wondering what a sail plan is I'm\njust about to enlighten you.

We also have our Mainsail which has the facility of being\nfour various different sizes. Now for those of you that don't sail you\u2019re\nprobably saying \u201cwhy so many?\u201d The reasoning behind all these options is really\nquite simple; the more wind there is, the less sail is required to move the\nboat at the same amount of speed. To be a fast boat you have to be able to\njudge these wind strength changes and put a larger or smaller sail up\naccordingly. Too much sail will leave the boat flat on its side instead of\nmoving forward and too little will result in the boat just not going anywhere,\nwhich is not conducive to a race.", "Yesterday we changed through our headsails which meant\nlowering them, unhanking (detaching) them, packing them and reversing that\nsequence to get a new one up. As the wind built we did the same with our Mainsail\nlowering it progressively. This requires lots of hard work from generally tired\nand wet people. Imagine trying to motivate the people in your companies at home\nif they haven't slept properly for 24 hours and been soaked to the bone for\nthat entire time, it wouldn't be easy.

As individuals, they have all bought something different and unique to\nthe boat and I can quite honestly say I would certainly go out for a drink with\neach and every one of them afterwards. I'm just going to take this time to do\nsome shout outs to my GREAT Britain crew. There have been highs, lows, and\nmoments of pure hilarity experienced by myself and the crew here onboard GREAT Britain. So, without further ado\nlet me introduce Jack Watch. ", "Spencer Bienvenue III (Watch Leader) - This 24 year-old\nhas led his watch full of predominantly argumentative middle-aged men and successfully\ngained the respect from each and every member individually for the hard work,\ndetermination, and focus he has placed upon sailing the boat in the right\ndirection at good speeds safely. He has also taken great responsibility in the\ndepletion of chocolate stocks - he tells me the boat will go faster if he eats\neverything in sight. ", "Mark Tucker (Team Coordinator and Assistant Watch Leader)\n\u2013 Firstly, I want to thank Mark for just being generally more organised than I\nam. He has been an absolute pillar when it comes to a good old spreadsheet and\nlamination session. Mark is also responsible for some of the best blogging I\nhave seen to date. Sorry Pip's Clips (Pip O\u2019Sullivan), but you know it's true.\nFrom the Carrot Inquest to the DIY Prep for Ocean racing simulations, he really\nhas had me crying with laughter as I read.", "John Olsen (Want to be teacher\u2019s pet and media man\nonboard) - You can tell just by his witty banter, his ability to have a smile\non his face in some of the worst situations, and his love for a bunk bed that\nhe most definitely went to boarding school. I did however overestimate his\nability to take a decent video or picture. This wasn't made known to me until I\ndiscovered all of the footage was either upside down or of his feet. His Cheshire\nCat smile, can-do attitude, and motivation to work hard towards the end goal\ndefinitely makes up for his media capabilities, and I look forward to sailing\nwith him again on Leg 2.", "Tessa Hicks (The medic you wondered how you never lived\nwithout) - Whether it's a plaster or a new limb, Tessa is there to help. She\nwhispers soothing words of support to crew members on their down days and has\nthe ability to put a positive spin on most situations. During the trip, she\nself-assigned to the sail repair team and is now considering a career change\nonce the race is over. As a circumnavigator, I couldn't ask for someone more\nwilling or supportive to help complete this huge challenge with. Well done so\nfar Tessa.", "Tim (Tetchy, Technical) Jeffery - Tim just quite simply\nmakes me smile. He has been my go to for navigation and trim, casting a second\nset of eyes over the whole situation which is probably why we are sat in a wind\nhole now. I'm secretly hoping he will leave me with his lucky silk undies and\nhis yellow fishing hat, making him look like a less serious Captain Birdseye.\nJoking aside, we will miss you Tim, and look forward to you coming back onboard\nfor Legs 3, 7, and 8.", "Ed Aldworth - We say goodbye to Ed after Leg 1. He has\nbeen a big asset to the team and a whole load of muscle on the bow, shifting\nsails from A to B, or sail locker to deck I should say. Ed stowed all of his\nbelongings under my bunk on the first day and then proceeded to litter the area\nbeside my bunk with his clothes which I labelled his \u2018floordrobe\u2019. I'll let him\noff though because he has always put in a strong stint in the galley, and is\nthe first to put his hand up for the dirtiest of jobs onboard, but I guess\nthat's just builders for you. Will miss you on board mate.", "Ian Medland (Medders) - What can I say? When it comes to\npushing yourself, this man knows all about it. Medders has shown true grit and\ndetermination through the toughest of times and I know this experience will\nstay with him for the rest of his life. Always good for a chat or a reassuring\narm round the shoulder when things aren't quite going to plan. Will miss you\nand Elmo after Leg 2.", "Ian Munford - The numbers man with the inside take on the\nmedia and TV world. Not a word of negativity has passed through this man\u2019s\nmouth since leaving Liverpool. I can always turn to Ian for a level-headed\nconversation, whilst weighing up the pros and cons of a decision - providing he\nremembers one hand for the boat and one for himself and stays on his feet ;-).\nAgain, will miss you on board after Leg 1.", "Jon Milne -  Mr Dry Sense of Humour. Always a\npleasure to be on watch with and even more of a pleasure when wearing facemasks\nfit for a child. Those that know Jon will know he likes a pie, a beer, and a\ngood game of rugby. Well, get ready for his reintroduction to life ashore. The\nman\u2019s six pack is just about poking through and he is almost ready for the\nphoto shoot as Mr March. ", "Nicola Thurlow - Our token teacher and chief of organisation.\nIf let loose, Nicola would try and run the boat on her enthusiasm and positive\nattitude alone. I hear her geography students had more practice on the balance\nboard than she did before joining. Looking forward to having you back onboard\nfor a few more legs on the GREAT Britain Boat.\nLet\u2019s just hug it out!!", "And now on to Union Watch....", "Headed up by Watch Leader and seamstress extraordinaire,\nSimon Speirs - Simon is a patient and meticulous man who prides himself on\nperfection when it comes to taking on the most intricate of tasks. He is one of\nmy go-to helms on the boat, and has managed to get the most out of the gaggle\nof girls on his watch. He has taken on the look over the last few days of\nIndiana Jones mixed with a hint of an arts student, with his white beard,\nleather necklace with wedding ring attached, and wide brimmed hat. Seriously\ncool guy if you ask me and I'm thankful to have him onboard for this Clipper Round\nthe World Yacht Race.", "Backing Simon up as Assistant Watch Leader is none other\nthan our very own ex-Olympic skier and commentator, Graham Bell. The guy just\nwon't sit still. Which I must admit is a massive bonus on an ocean racing yacht\nwhen you're pushing for podium -\u2013 that is, if he's not showering on the back.\nHe is like an alarm clock, every sched I will find him sat by my bunk waking me\nto find our latest position. Love the enthusiasm and will definitely miss the\ndrive for the remainder of the race.", "Pip O'Sullivan - What can I say? If she\u2019s not busy\nfilming or blogging for Pip\u2019s Clips, she\u2019s entertaining someone on board. I'm\nsure every boat has one!! A Pip that is!! She is great for morale and always up\nto something a little ridiculous to entertain the masses. You are like a\nbrother from another mother. Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing!! ", "Catherine Foster is the queen of stowage and heir to the\nstowage throne. In fact, I've never seen anyone so excited about a label making\nmachine, it's a bit of a worry really. She provides the boat with a lot of\ngiggles especially when mounting and dismounting her bunkbed, needless to say\nshe did not qualify for next year\u2019s bedroom Olympics. A 45-degree angle has\noften brought tears to her eyes and going to the toilet is not her favourite\npast time on board. Catherine, I will miss you!!!", "Ray Gibson will fix it. What a guy!! Who's the man? Ray's\nthe man!! Since joining the boat, none of the tools are in the tool box but now\nhave made their way to a cloth bag that Ray carries around the boat with him to\nfix the odds and sods, from winches, tin openers, and generators. Believe it or\nnot, the tin openers provided the greatest challenge. SO happy to have him as\none of my circumnavigators. Can Ray fix it??!! Yes he can!!", "Phil 'THE' Gunn - This guy is the King of Cool. He has a\nsuper relaxed vibe. From his washing techniques to his helming ability, Phil\nhas it covered usually from a horizontal position. As our Engineer on the boat,\nhe can often be found whispering sweet nothings to one of his mistresses, the\ngenerator, water maker, or main engine. As another circumnavigator, I'm\nconfident this guy will keep my stress levels low, or at least give me whatever\nhe is taking. It's been a pleasure so far!!!", "Krishna Patel - The girl with the constant smile on her\nface, even when she is nursing a sick bag and throwing up into it for the fifteenth\ntime in one day. She is absolutely fantastic on deck and gets on with\nabsolutely everyone. I think her motto is 'If you ain't got nothing nice to\nsay, don't say nothing at all'. Can't wait to see you in Australia mateee.", "Gareth Blanks - Our very own pantomime dame. This guy loves\na list and has a fetish with the back end of the boat. Since being on board, he\ncan be found pottering around the Lazerette or constructing things around the\nboat. I have had to confiscate his angle grinder due to fear he may start\ngrinding through the structure to increase space, or elongate his bunk. I have\na list ready for you in port, because I know how much you love a list.", "Antonia Hiesgen- Antonia is a very useful crew member to\nbe used to distract my good friend Chris, the German Skipper on Qingdao. If he gets close tomorrow, I'm\nconsidering hoisting her up the mast as a distraction tactic. She's also the queen\nof hot chocolate making and ace on Galley Duty.
